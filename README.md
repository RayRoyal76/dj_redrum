# DJ RedRum
The project for my first Hackathon

# Purpose
This project was my attempt at understanding Spring Boot, HTML, and JavaScript.
Though not completed at this, the idea was:
- to search for an artist on the VEVO channel through YouTube
- retreive the title and video id from the list
- enter the the video id onto the page
- then enjoy your selection

# Example

Here is the site for video info
- http://localhost:8080/api/music/IceCube

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72403835/99099996-38f1bf00-25a9-11eb-9676-749a3567b1d7.jpg" width="90%"></img> 

- The items display the video id and the snippet displays the title
- Let's take the first section ("videoId": "rY0QILwcCLw" & "title": "Straight Outta Compton â€“ Vevo Exclusive Deleted Song Performance (Explicit)")
- The idea is to have a field to enter that and have it link to the video

- This is what comes up at the moment

-And when you press "Play Video"

# The Plan

- I want to continue to research and finish with using React and JavaScript in order to complete the link between the code and the web page
- Enhance wep page using HTML and CSS

# Takeaway

- Though this seems like a more primitive form of retrieving videos from YouTube, it was interesting to see the process unfold to a degree.
- I would like to see if there are other APIs that would work without certain limitations
